The Kubernetes scheduler is a critical control plane component responsible for assigning Pods to nodes in the cluster. Operating as part of the kube-scheduler service, it continuously watches for newly created Pods that lack a node assignment and determines the optimal placement for each Pod based on various scheduling principles and constraints.

The scheduling process operates through a sophisticated two-step mechanism for each Pod. During the filtering phase, the scheduler identifies all feasible nodes where the Pod could potentially run. This involves evaluating nodes against requirements such as resource availability, where checks like PodFitsResources verify whether candidate nodes possess sufficient CPU, memory, and other resources to meet the Pod's specific requests. Following filtering, the scoring phase ranks the remaining viable nodes to identify the most suitable placement. The scheduler assigns numerical scores to each node that survived filtering based on active scoring rules, ultimately selecting the node with the highest ranking. In cases where multiple nodes receive equal scores, the scheduler randomly selects among them to ensure fair distribution.

The scheduler's decision-making process considers numerous factors including individual and collective resource requirements, hardware and software constraints, policy limitations, affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data locality requirements, inter-workload interference patterns, and topology considerations. This comprehensive evaluation ensures that workload placement optimizes both resource utilization and application performance while respecting operational constraints.

### Pod Assignment Mechanisms

Kubernetes provides multiple mechanisms for controlling Pod placement on nodes, each serving different use cases and offering varying levels of control. The nodeSelector field represents the simplest form of node selection constraint, allowing you to specify required node labels that target nodes must possess. While straightforward to use, nodeSelector only supports simple equality-based matching where all specified labels must be present on the selected node.

Node affinity expands upon nodeSelector capabilities with a more expressive language and flexible matching options. The requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution rules function similarly to nodeSelector but support complex expressions using operators like In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist, Gt, and Lt. These rules must be satisfied for Pod scheduling to proceed. Meanwhile, preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution rules express soft preferences that the scheduler attempts to honor but will not prevent Pod scheduling if unsatisfied. Each preferred rule can specify a weight between 1 and 100, influencing the scoring phase of scheduling decisions.

Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity rules enable you to constrain Pod placement based on the labels of other Pods already running in the cluster rather than node characteristics. These rules prove particularly valuable for scenarios requiring workload co-location to minimize latency or workload spreading to ensure high availability. Pod affinity attracts Pods to nodes where specific other Pods are running, while anti-affinity repels them. Both types support required (hard) and preferred (soft) variants. The topology domain for these rules is specified through the topologyKey field, which references node labels defining the boundary for the rule evaluation, such as zones, regions, or individual hostnames.

The nodeName field provides the most direct form of node selection by explicitly specifying the target node name in the Pod specification. However, this approach bypasses the scheduler entirely and should generally be avoided except in special circumstances, as it can lead to resource conflicts and scheduling inefficiencies. When a Pod specifies nodeName, the kubelet on that node attempts to run the Pod regardless of resource availability or other constraints.

### Pod Overhead and Resource Accounting

Pod overhead accounting addresses the resource consumption of Pod infrastructure beyond container requirements. This mechanism becomes particularly relevant when using virtualization-based container runtimes that introduce additional resource overhead for virtual machines and guest operating systems. The overhead is defined within RuntimeClass objects and automatically applied to Pods using that RuntimeClass.

When Pod overhead is configured, it affects multiple aspects of the Kubernetes resource management system. During scheduling, the overhead is added to the sum of container requests when evaluating node capacity and making placement decisions. For resource quotas, both container requests and overhead count against the quota limits. The kubelet includes overhead when creating Pod cgroups, setting appropriate limits based on the combined container and overhead requirements. This ensures accurate resource accounting and prevents resource starvation due to unaccounted infrastructure overhead.

The implementation of Pod overhead maintains consistency across the entire Pod lifecycle. At admission time, the RuntimeClass admission controller mutates the Pod specification to include the defined overhead. This overhead then influences scheduling decisions, cgroup configuration, eviction rankings, and resource quota calculations, providing a comprehensive solution for accounting infrastructure resource consumption.

### Pod Scheduling Readiness and Gates

Pod scheduling readiness, controlled through scheduling gates, provides a mechanism to delay Pod scheduling until specific conditions are met. This feature addresses scenarios where Pods might remain unschedulable for extended periods due to missing dependencies or resources, preventing unnecessary scheduler churn and improving overall system efficiency.

Scheduling gates are specified as a list of string values in the Pod specification, with each string representing a condition that must be satisfied before the Pod becomes schedulable. Gates can only be added during Pod creation and must be removed sequentially to make the Pod eligible for scheduling. Pods with scheduling gates remain in a SchedulingGated state until all gates are cleared, at which point they transition to normal scheduling behavior.

This mechanism proves particularly valuable for complex deployments where Pods depend on external resources, custom resource provisioning, or specific cluster state conditions. By preventing premature scheduling attempts, scheduling gates reduce scheduler load and provide clearer operational semantics for Pod dependencies. Additionally, while Pods have scheduling gates, certain scheduling directives can be modified with restrictions, allowing for limited runtime adjustments to Pod scheduling requirements.

### Topology Spread Constraints

Topology spread constraints offer fine-grained control over Pod distribution across cluster topology domains such as zones, regions, or nodes. These constraints help achieve high availability by preventing Pod concentration in single failure domains while also optimizing resource utilization and reducing cross-zone network traffic costs.

Each topology spread constraint defines several key parameters. The maxSkew value specifies the maximum permitted difference in Pod count between topology domains. The topologyKey identifies the node label defining the topology domain, such as zone or hostname labels. The whenUnsatisfiable field determines the behavior when constraints cannot be met, either preventing scheduling with DoNotSchedule or attempting best-effort placement with ScheduleAnyway. Label selectors identify which Pods count toward the spread calculation, while optional fields like minDomains, nodeAffinityPolicy, and nodeTaintsPolicy provide additional control over constraint evaluation.

Multiple topology spread constraints can be combined to control spreading across different topology levels simultaneously. For example, you might require even distribution across zones while also spreading Pods across nodes within each zone. The scheduler evaluates all constraints using logical AND operations, requiring all specified constraints to be satisfied for successful Pod placement. This enables sophisticated distribution strategies that balance availability, performance, and cost considerations.

### Taints and Tolerations

The taints and tolerations mechanism allows nodes to repel Pods unless those Pods explicitly tolerate the taints. This system provides a flexible way to dedicate nodes for specific purposes, handle node problems, and control Pod placement in heterogeneous clusters. Taints are applied to nodes with a key, value, and effect, while tolerations are specified in Pod specifications to allow scheduling despite matching taints.

Three taint effects control the scheduling and execution behavior. NoSchedule prevents new Pod scheduling on tainted nodes unless Pods have matching tolerations. PreferNoSchedule represents a soft preference where the scheduler attempts to avoid placing Pods on tainted nodes but will do so if necessary. NoExecute not only prevents scheduling but also evicts running Pods that lack appropriate tolerations, with configurable grace periods for Pod termination.

The system automatically applies several built-in taints for node conditions such as not-ready, unreachable, memory-pressure, disk-pressure, pid-pressure, network-unavailable, and unschedulable states. These automatic taints integrate with the eviction system to handle node problems gracefully. DaemonSet controllers automatically add appropriate tolerations to their Pods, ensuring critical system components continue running despite node issues.

### Scheduling Framework Architecture

The scheduling framework represents a pluggable architecture that structures the scheduler's operation into distinct extension points where plugins can influence scheduling decisions. This design maintains a lightweight scheduling core while enabling sophisticated scheduling behaviors through composable plugins.

The framework divides each Pod scheduling attempt into two primary phases. The scheduling cycle selects a node for the Pod through multiple stages including queue sorting, pre-filtering, filtering, post-filtering, pre-scoring, scoring, score normalization, and reservation. The binding cycle then applies the scheduling decision to the cluster through pre-bind, bind, and post-bind stages. Scheduling cycles run serially to maintain consistency, while binding cycles may execute concurrently for improved throughput.

Each extension point serves a specific purpose in the scheduling pipeline. QueueSort plugins determine Pod ordering in the scheduling queue. PreFilter plugins preprocess Pod information and check prerequisites. Filter plugins eliminate unsuitable nodes from consideration. PostFilter plugins attempt to make Pods schedulable through actions like preemption when no feasible nodes exist initially. Score plugins rank feasible nodes, with NormalizeScore plugins adjusting scores before final ranking. Reserve plugins maintain stateful information about resource reservations, while Permit plugins can approve, deny, or delay Pod binding. Finally, Bind plugins handle the actual Pod-to-node binding operation.

### Dynamic Resource Allocation

Dynamic resource allocation extends Kubernetes to handle generic resources beyond traditional CPU and memory, particularly targeting devices like GPUs and other specialized hardware. This API generalizes the persistent volume concept for arbitrary resources, with resource tracking and preparation handled by third-party drivers while Kubernetes manages allocation through structured parameters.

The resource allocation system introduces several new API objects. ResourceClaims describe requests for resources with specific properties, tracking allocation status and assigned resources. ResourceClaimTemplates define specifications for creating per-Pod ResourceClaims automatically. DeviceClasses contain predefined selection criteria and configuration for devices, created by administrators during driver installation. ResourceSlices publish information about available resources in the cluster, while DeviceTaintRules enable administrators to add taints to devices without driver involvement.

The scheduler performs allocation by retrieving available resources from ResourceSlice objects, tracking existing allocations, and selecting appropriate resources for new claims. Selection uses CEL expressions evaluating device attributes and capacities, with support for complex constraints and requirements. The allocation decision is recorded in the ResourceClaim status along with vendor-specific configuration, providing drivers with necessary information for resource preparation when Pods start.

Advanced features enhance the flexibility of dynamic resource allocation. Admin access mode enables privileged operations for maintenance and troubleshooting. Device status reporting allows drivers to publish device-specific status information. Prioritized lists specify alternative device preferences when primary choices are unavailable. Partitionable devices support logical devices composed of multiple physical devices with shared resources. Device taints and tolerations provide fine-grained control over device usage, similar to node taints but operating at the device level.

### Pod Priority and Preemption

Pod priority and preemption mechanisms ensure critical workloads receive necessary resources by allowing higher-priority Pods to displace lower-priority ones when resources are constrained. This system operates through PriorityClasses that map names to integer priority values, with higher values indicating greater importance.

PriorityClasses are cluster-scoped objects defining priority levels from -2147483648 to 1000000000, with values above this range reserved for system-critical components. The globalDefault field designates a default priority for Pods without explicit priority specifications. The preemptionPolicy field controls whether Pods of a given priority class can preempt others, with options for standard preemption or non-preempting behavior where Pods gain scheduling priority without displacing running workloads.

During scheduling, the scheduler orders Pods by priority in the scheduling queue, attempting to place higher-priority Pods first. When a Pod cannot be scheduled due to resource constraints, the preemption logic searches for nodes where evicting lower-priority Pods would enable scheduling. The scheduler considers factors including graceful termination periods, PodDisruptionBudgets (though these are best-effort during preemption), and inter-Pod affinity relationships when selecting victims for eviction.

The preemption process provides visibility through the nominatedNodeName field in Pod status, indicating where the scheduler intends to place the Pod after preemption completes. However, Pods may ultimately be scheduled elsewhere if conditions change during the preemption process, such as other nodes becoming available or higher-priority Pods arriving.

### Node Pressure Eviction

Node pressure eviction represents the kubelet's mechanism for proactively terminating Pods to reclaim resources when nodes experience resource exhaustion. This process operates independently of API-initiated evictions and focuses on preventing node instability due to resource starvation.

The kubelet monitors multiple eviction signals including memory availability, disk space on various filesystems (nodefs, imagefs, containerfs), inode availability, and process ID availability on Linux systems. These signals are compared against configurable eviction thresholds to determine when eviction is necessary. Hard eviction thresholds trigger immediate Pod termination without grace periods when exceeded. Soft eviction thresholds require the condition to persist for a specified duration before triggering eviction with configurable grace periods.

When eviction thresholds are met, the kubelet first attempts to reclaim node-level resources through garbage collection of dead containers and Pods, and deletion of unused images. The reclamation strategy varies based on the filesystem configuration, with different actions for nodefs, imagefs, and containerfs pressure. If resource reclamation proves insufficient, the kubelet proceeds to evict end-user Pods based on a prioritized ranking system.

Pod eviction ordering considers multiple factors including whether Pods exceed their resource requests, Pod priority levels, and the ratio of actual usage to requests. BestEffort and Burstable Pods exceeding requests are evicted first, ordered by priority and excess usage. Guaranteed Pods and Burstable Pods within requests are evicted last, based solely on priority. This ordering ensures that Pods consuming resources beyond their allocations are removed before those operating within their reserved resources.

The kubelet reports node conditions such as MemoryPressure, DiskPressure, and PIDPressure when eviction thresholds are met, with these conditions automatically mapped to node taints that prevent new Pod scheduling. Configuration options like eviction-minimum-reclaim ensure meaningful resource recovery during eviction cycles, while eviction-pressure-transition-period prevents condition oscillation from rapid threshold crossing.

### API-Initiated Eviction

API-initiated eviction provides a controlled mechanism for removing Pods from nodes while respecting configured disruption budgets and termination grace periods. This process creates an Eviction object through the Eviction API, triggering graceful Pod termination that honors operational constraints.

The eviction API performs admission checks before allowing eviction, returning different HTTP status codes based on the evaluation results. A 200 OK response indicates successful eviction with Pod deletion proceeding. A 429 Too Many Requests response indicates the eviction would violate a PodDisruptionBudget, suggesting retry at a later time. A 500 Internal Server Error response indicates misconfiguration such as multiple PodDisruptionBudgets referencing the same Pod.

When eviction is approved, the Pod deletion follows a structured sequence. The API server updates the Pod resource with a deletion timestamp and grace period. The kubelet notices the termination marker and begins graceful shutdown of the local Pod. During shutdown, the control plane removes the Pod from service endpoints to prevent new traffic routing. After the grace period expires, the kubelet forcefully terminates any remaining processes and notifies the API server to remove the Pod resource entirely.

This eviction mechanism integrates with various Kubernetes tools and workflows. The kubectl drain command uses the eviction API to safely remove Pods when preparing nodes for maintenance. Cluster autoscalers employ eviction to consolidate workloads when scaling down. Custom controllers and operators can programmatically request evictions while respecting application availability requirements through PodDisruptionBudgets.
